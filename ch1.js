// Secrets of the Javascript Ninja

/*
Writing effective, clean code.
An additional problem - the difficulties of making things work cross-browser.
Standard libraries - jQuery etc - we will study these to gain insight into 1 and 2 above.

The makeup of a js library:

	- advanced use of js language
	- cross-browser code
	- best practices

The js language:
	- objects, functions
	- anonymous inline functions
	- closures

A close relationship between objects, functions and closures which must be understood for a good foundation.

Underused language features:
	- timers
	- regexes
	- with statement
	- eval

Best practices:
	- testing
		- assert function: assert(condition, message);
	- performance analysis
		- perf function
	- debugging skills

These are especially important in the restricted js development environment.
